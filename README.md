# Invo-AI
We propose an extraction system that uses knowledge of the types of the target fields to generate extraction candidates, and a neural network architecture that learns a dense representation of each candidate based on the neighbouring words in the document. These learned representations are not only useful in solving the extraction task for unseen document templates from two different domains, but are also interpretable in classic document processing.
